fix(client): implement comprehensive tailwind and react mount fix

This commit implements the comprehensive fix provided by Spencer to address two core issues:
1. Tailwind CSS Purge: The tailwind.config.js was misconfigured, leading to the purging of all utility classes in the production build. The new configuration correctly specifies the content paths and includes a safelist.
2. React Mount Failure: The React application was not mounting correctly, resulting in a blank page. This was resolved by creating a new `app.css`, importing it into `main.tsx`, and cleaning up `index.html` to ensure the Vite build process works as expected.
